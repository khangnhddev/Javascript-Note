**What is console.dir?**

console.dir displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object. Unlike console.log, which prints the object in a flat, stringified format, console.dir provides a hierarchical view, making it easier to explore and understand the structure of the object.

**Dom**

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, which makes it possible for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with the page.
